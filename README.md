## romnn's homebrew tap

A collection of software I wrote or modified.
Most projects are distributed as small, dependency-free, statically-linked binaries for both macos _and_ linux.

#### Installation example

```bash
brew install romnn/tap/cargo-fc

# to install <project>, do
brew install romnn/tap/<project>
```
