## romnn's homebrew tap

A collection of software I wrote or modified.
Most projects are distributed as small, dependency-free, statically-linked binaries for both macos _and_ linux.

#### Installation example

```bash
# formulas
brew install romnn/tap/<formula-name>

# casks
brew install --cask romnn/tap/<cask-name>
```
